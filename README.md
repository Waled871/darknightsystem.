Rules for users

The first and only rule is to use common sense in everything you do. Just behave in a respectful way to everything and everyone, and you will be fine. If a moderator notices that you are not, they can and will take action. In particular, we expect all of this from you:

• Be respectful to each other. You might disagree with someone, but that doesn't mean you get to try and make them feel unwelcome here.

    - In particular, this includes new people. If you don't have anything nice or helpful to say, don't say anything at all.

    - Political/controversial/potentially charged topics are allowed, so long as those discussions remain civil.

• Don't use slurs, not even if you are a part of the group the slur is directed at. Even if you use one as a "joke," you will be banned without warning.

• Let mods handle mod stuff. We appreciate that you want to help, but please, ping a moderator, even for small stuff. It's what we're here for.

Also, this is a SFW server. That includes both images and text. If you're not sure if something might be NSFW, lean towards not posting it, or ask a mod first.

Reporting something to the moderation team:

• To report a misbehaving/spamming bot, use the command pls pinghelpers in the channel where it happens, together with a short note about what is happening.

• To report a misbehaving user, use pls pingmods in the channel where it is happening, also together with a short explanation of what is going on.

• To report anything else, DM @MW AHMAD  which is our custom modmail bot. This way, all moderators will see it at once.
